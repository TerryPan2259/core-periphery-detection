Any other algorithms?
=====================

cpalgorithm  mainly provides density-based core-periphery structure.
Other types of core-periphery structure such as transportation-based core-periphery structure is left for future update.

If you have a code for other algorithms and are willing to add it to this library, please contact the `developer <>`.
