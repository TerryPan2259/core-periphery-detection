[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skojaku/cpalgorithm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skojaku/cpalgorithm)

This Python library contains various algorithms for finding core-periphery structure in networks.

Currently, I'm testing code, which will be finished til at the end of July 2018.
