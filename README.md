# core-periphery-detection
Python library for finding core-periphery structure in networks

The code will be available in few days.

In this project, I'll implement a python library for various core-periphery detection algorithms in networks, including 
the gold-standard Borgatti-Everett algorithm, MINRES, Rombach's algorithm for finding continuous core-periphery structure and Kojaku-Masuda algorithms.
